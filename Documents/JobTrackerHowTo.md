# The Job Tracker

The job tracker can be used to track the current status of many different job applications at a glance. This application was created with the purpose of learning the basics of WPF.

## UI Explination

A. The Jobs list section shows a list of the jobs that have been added into Job Tracker. The jobs in the list can be clicked on to display their information in Section E.

B. The Calendar highlights dates where changes were made to the jobs in Job Tracker. This allows the user to see at a glance what days they worked on their job hunt. Clicking on a day shows information about what happened on that day in the Calendar Info section (Section C).

C. The Calendar Info section provides information on what progress was made in the job hunt on the given date.

D. The Button section allows the user to save their current data as an XML file, Load previous data from an XML file, Add a new job, or remove the currently selected job.

E. The Job Breakdown section shows detailed information about the selected job. Information changed here is reflected in the Job list section (Section A), the Calendar (Section B) and the Calendar Info section (Section C).
