1) Documentation - I wrote a technical design document that laid out the core tool functionality to implement. For this project, The two core elements were a list of jobs with various information about them and a calendar that showed that information at a glance.

2) UI/UX Implementation - I worked in VisualStudio to create an in-editor UI to ensure both the initial documented ideas feel feasible and the layout makes sense from a UX perspective. This turned up some information that didn't need to be tracked

3) Documentation - Update the original design document to reflect discoveries from the UI setup.

4) Backend - I hooked up the backend of the UI to ensure everything worked as it appeared to.

5) Test - I tested the functionality I had added to ensure it worked as expected.

6) UI/UX Implementation - I went back to the design doc and reviewed what was needed from the calendar view and then implemented that visually in WPF.

7) Backend - I hooked up the backend of the UI to ensure everything worked as it appeared to for the calendar

8) Test and iterate - I started putting in all of my jobs to dogfood the project and turn up UX issues I previously missed and fixed bugs that showed up

9) Document - I updated the technical documentation to reflect the current state of the project, wrote out tutorial information to make sure the program was easy to use and wrote out installation information to ensure it could be used by folks who may not know how to run unsigned programs.

10) Publish - I set up an automated deployment workflow in GitHub to ensure a single link to the project would always provide the most up-to-date version.
